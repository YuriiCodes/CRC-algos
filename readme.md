# CRC Algorithms Performance Comparison 📊

This project compares the performance of different CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) algorithms. The algorithms included are:

- Serial CRC
- Table-based CRC
- Mirrored CRC
- Mirrored Table-based CRC

## Requirements 📦

To install the required dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🚀

To run the comparison, execute the `main.py` script:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Project Structure 📁

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the CRC algorithms and measures their performance.
- `algos/`: Directory containing the different CRC algorithm implementations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.


## Example Output 📈

The script will output a table comparing the CRC results and execution times for each algorithm:

```
Algorithm        CRC    Time
-------------  -----  ------
Serial           ...    ...
Table            ...    ...
Mirrored         ...    ...
Mirrored Table   ...    ...
```
